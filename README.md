### Personal Book List Manager

#### My Capstone for PDX Codeguild/Class_Iguana

Booklite is a personal book-list manager for those who want to capture titles and authors that they decide they want to remember and later link to useful bibliographic and acquisitinal information. You can think of it as GoodReads without the social media piece.

The home page will have a search input for title (and/or author) and probably button to execute a function to do a title and author search using an ajax call to the Open Library api https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/api/search or something similar.

We will parse the json object and collect the title and author name, cover image + anything else useful in a basic sense. This will be stored in data tables.

The information stored can later be used in searches of online booksellers and libraries with links using views when a particular title/record is selected. I may bring availability and pricing info back into the app from the link results (version 2)
